# logic_gates_sim
This program will simulate the behaviour of logic circuits.

For example a JK-FF:

The gates update each frame and the wires update instantly on their parent gate update.
There are currently 2 logic sources and 1 output destination. the inputs can be interacted with by left/middle clicking them.

### TODO:
Make the gates update instantly on wire change. right now there can occur a delay depending on placement order.
